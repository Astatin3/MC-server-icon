# MC Server icon

In-game server icon editing using a map.
The idea behind this, is that anyone can draw on the server icon.

### How to use:
1) Create a filled map (Use the smallest sized map for the best results)
2) Find the top left corner of the map, and find the center block of the map. (The smallest sized map should have its center 64x64 blocks in the positive XZ direction)
3) Build whatever you need to in the top left quadrant of the map
4) run /favicon, and the map should be updated
